# automated-vehicles-self-interest-driving-strategies
The project is my capstone project in Beijing University Of Technolodgy and was finished by June 2020.

On the one hand, this project proposed automated vehicle driving strategies based on reinforcement learning, which better meets the uncertainty and intelligence characteristics of autonomous driving; On the other hand, investigating the effect of automated vehicles on mixed traffic flow lays the foundation for controlling the number of automated vehicles on the road in the future, increasing the speed of AVs and improving the efficiency of traffic system.
